# Research index

Updated: 2026-10-05. Setup complete; research has not started.
Baseline: [B000](BASELINE.md). No new improvement has been established.

This is the routing and decision index. Detailed evidence lives in linked
records. Update a row and the active experiment's resume state when work stops.

## Registers

| ID | Question / record | State | Outcome / evidence | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B000 | [Starting extension baseline](BASELINE.md) | Inventoried | Existing development evidence; no fresh confirmation | Reproduce before first comparison |

No experiment, dataset, finding or promotion records have been created yet.
Allocate the next unused ID in each series: `E001`, `D001`, `F001`, `P001`.
Use relative links here; append rows rather than reusing IDs.

Experiment states: `planned`, `running`, `complete`, `blocked`.
Completed outcomes: `improved`, `no-improvement`, `inconclusive`, `invalid`.
Evidence maturity: `exploratory`, `development`, `confirmed` (see the protocol).
Promotion states: `proposed`, `deferred`, `rejected`, `accepted`, `implemented`.
A positive experiment and an adoption decision are separate records.

## Backlog, in priority order

These are research questions, not registered hypotheses or claims of success.
The first goal should turn the relevant question into a dated experiment plan.

| Priority | Track | Question and needed evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Measurement and datasets | Define what an accuracy percentage, a single-game performance rating and each label should mean. Choose falsifiable targets, metrics, meaningful effect thresholds and fresh split ownership before candidate fitting. Inventory existing data reuse and collection cost. |
| 2 | Accuracy | Which outcome/choice models and aggregation rules improve predictive validity and robustness to easy moves, game length and search noise? Assess SF18 and SF19 separately, and justify the displayed scale beyond engine agreement. |
| 3 | Moves-only rating | Can rating-level prediction improve over current regressions and simple training-only baselines, with calibrated uncertainty, player-disjoint evaluation and useful coverage? Specify platform, rating pool and time control. |
| 4 | Contextual rating | Does conditioning on recorded rating provide useful information beyond retaining that rating? Separate peer-quality distribution prediction from evidence for the final rating adjustment. |
| 5 | Move categories | Can loss bands and special annotations better support understandable, defensible explanations? Define our label rubric, acquire blinded independent reviews, report disagreement and test rare classes as well as ordinary moves. |

Cross-cutting checks: mate and forced moves, history/setup positions, openings,
short games, rating/skill bands, time controls, winning/lost positions, engine
stability, latency, unavailable evidence and fallback behavior.

## Next session

Start the measurement/dataset plan using [the experiment template](templates/experiment.md).
Reproduce B000, inventory available evidence and its prior use, and choose the
first tractable hypothesis. Do not call existing development data a fresh test.
The user will initiate the research goal separately.
